      <h1>Web Design Philosophy</h1>
      <p>In my class, I have learned basic HTML and CSS. I have also done several projects from my teacher to help improve upon my skills. In the beginning, I really struggled with HTML and CSS. This is because it felt like learning a whole new language that was set on the foundations of English, but as I kept learning, I improved more and more. While improving my skills, I have realized that having principles can help me make a good website. Without principles, you really donâ€™t have any ideas or foundation to start from. These are the principles I have chosen to have.</p>
      
      <p>Web design should combine creativity and functionality so that people enjoy using my website but also doing the things that they want to do. My philosophy is to create sites that look nice, but more importantly, are easy to use. I believe that a site should look good, be easily accessible, and function properly. Right now, everything is online, and without a good website, a company would not be noticed easily.</p>

      <p>Simple design is among the things that I believe should be part of my principles. I believe that it is better to have less rather than more when designing websites. A design that is too complicated might confuse people and cause them to leave the site. By using simple layouts with easy navigation and organized content, I can create websites that are easy to use. Simple design and functionality work well together, as it can remove unnecessary steps and make navigation easier.</p>

      <p>Another one of my principles is to try and make the site work on all devices. With the increasing use of mobile devices, it is essential that websites look good no matter what screen size you have. It's essential for a website to work on all devices, whether it's a tablet, phone, or computer. Responsive design not only improves user experience but also helps websites to be better ranked on search engines, making it an essential part of web design.</p>

      <p>Accessibility is also a big part of my philosophy, as I believe sites should be accessible to everyone, whether they have a disability or not. I try to create sites that work with accessibility standards so that anyone can access them. I can achieve this by using things like alt text for images, high contrast, and keyboard navigation, I can ensure that my website is accessible to everyone.</p>

      <p>Collaboration is a part of the web design process. You usually work with people with various roles, such as the client, developer, and designers, to create a good website. Communicating and collaborating with your team can help create a website that everyone likes. Collaboration helps ensure that things like design and functionality align with project goals.</p>

      <p>Finally, constantly learning is important to attract people to your site. Trends are constantly changing, and because of that, I believe it is essential to learn and adapt as needed. I try to improve my skills by learning in class and making websites on my own. By using these ideas, I can create good websites that can adapt to the changing world of the Internet.</p>
