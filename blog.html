      <h3>Learning HTML</h3>
      <p>I started by learning basic HTML tags like headings, paragraphs, links, and lists. It was exciting to build structure for a real website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Getting Started with CSS</h3>
      <p>CSS helped me make my site look much better. I learned about colors, spacing, and fonts. It’s like painting over your HTML framework.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Making My First Website</h3>
      <p>My first website was basic but felt like a huge milestone. I used a combination of HTML and CSS to make a simple but functional page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Graphic Design Practice</h3>
      <p>Using Photoshop, I tried editing images and playing with color and text effects. It gave me a better eye for layout and balance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Learning Dreamweaver</h3>
      <p>I used Dreamweaver to code my pages and preview them live. It helped a lot with keeping my HTML and CSS organized and clean. It also saved a lot of time as I didn't need to keep going back and refreshing the page on the browser</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>How I Made My Website Mobile-Friendly</h3>
      <p>I used media queries and flexible widths so the site would look good on both phones and laptops. It took some trial and error but was worth it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Comparing Early vs. Recent Projects</h3>
      <p>Looking at my old sites like Robocat and comparing them to Sweet Treats Bakery, I can see how much I’ve improved. It’s encouraging to see progress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What I’d Do Differently Next Time</h3>
      <p>Next time, I’d spend more time planning layouts and use more consistent styles. I’ve learned that thinking ahead saves a lot of fixing later.</p>
    </div>
	 
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Picking Fonts and Colors That Work Together Nicely</h3>
      <p>When I first started, the colors didn't match well together. It looked sloppy and honestly needed a lot of work. I also didn't think much about fonts as I thought having the default font was okay. It wasn't later until I realized how important fonts were, especially if I wanted to page to look nice.</p>

      		<h3>A Logo I Made</h3>
      		<p>This is a logo I made when my teacher assigned to do so. The idea was to make a new logo for a company he chose and he would grade it depending on how much effot we put into it.</p>

      		<h3>An Article I Found Surprising</h3>
      		<p>The news article about election-scams was surprising. Out of all the scams, I never knew these types of scams existed. As I thoroughly read the article, I was surprised by the use of AI in these types of scams. Apparently, AI was being used to make fake news articles and such.</p>

			<img src="article2-preview.jpeg" alt="An article preview about semiconductor funding">
      		<h3>An Article I Found Interesting</h3>
      		<p>I found the article I chose interesting because it was about a semiconductor research facility. When I saw that New York was funding $825 million into a semiconductor research facility, I wondered, "Why would New York give so much money. What's so important about it?" When I read the article even further, I learned that they were researching better computer chips. Apparently, they need better computer chips to give the military an advantage. This is what I found interesting this week. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the exact article. I can provide another article that has similar info</p>

			<img src="image2.gif" alt="A Thanksgiving Clipping Mask">
      		<h3>Clipping Mask</h3>
      		<p>I thought this was interesting because of the topic. I really never thought about the things I was grateful for. I just used to go around, never stopping to appreciate the things that I should be grateful for. But now, I realized I have a lot of things to be grateful for, like my parents, for giving life to me and always cooking delicious food, and my brother, who always makes my life interesting.</p>

      		<h3>Questions From Daily Ticket</h3>
      		<p>I found this Daily Ticket interesting because it really opened my eyes. I noticed that I was making a lot of mistakes such as procrastinating, being distracted while having an assignment to do, and not asking for feedback or help when I do a task. I learned that by fixing these mistakes, I could really increase my own personal value proposition and really improve in general. Learning these skills can help me later in life.</p>

			<img src="article3-preview.png" alt="Article preview about exhausted AI data">
      		<h3>An Article I Found Interesting</h3>
      		<p>I found this interesting because it is about AI. AI is an industry and science that is rapidly growing and becoming more popular. Many people have already started to use AI for a multitude of tasks such as writing, planning, questions, and more. The article that I chose was an interesting one, as it talked about how almost all AI companies have run out of real data to train their AIs with. This in turn led to them using synthetic data, data that they make to train AI. This can lead to several problems. One is that it can develop bias and thus be less reliable. Another is that the data might not be entirely true.  This is this Week's Interesting Thing for me.</p>
